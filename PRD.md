# Product Requirements Document: Universal File Converter Web App

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-04-12
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Introduction & Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the requirements for a new web application, the "Universal File Converter". The purpose of this application is to provide a comprehensive, fast, secure, reliable, and user-friendly online platform for converting files between a wide variety of formats across different categories (documents, images, audio, video, archives).

### 1.2 Project Vision
To become the leading online destination for file conversion needs, recognized for its extensive format support, superior performance, robust security, intuitive user experience, and flexible access model catering to both casual and professional users globally.

### 1.3 Goals
* Launch a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) encompassing the core architecture and a broad range of essential features and conversion types as quickly as possible ("ASAP").
* Achieve high user satisfaction through reliable conversions, speed, and ease of use.
* Support a large number of common and essential file formats accurately.
* Implement a sustainable Freemium/Subscription model.
* Establish a reputation for strong security and user privacy.
* Target global user adoption.

## 2. Target Audience

The application aims to serve a broad audience, with design considerations for each:

* **General Users:** Individuals needing occasional, quick conversions of common file types (e.g., JPG to PNG, DOCX to PDF). Require a simple, intuitive interface.
* **Media Creators (Designers, Videographers, Musicians):** Require support for various media formats, advanced conversion options (quality, resolution, bitrate), and batch processing.
* **Office Workers & Students:** Need reliable document conversion (DOCX, PDF, ODT, etc.), high fidelity, PDF manipulation tools (merge, split, OCR), and potentially spreadsheet/presentation conversions.
* **Power Users & Businesses:** Value efficiency, batch processing, cloud storage integration, potentially API access (future), and priority support/performance.
* **Privacy-Conscious Users:** Appreciate strong security measures, clear data handling policies (especially immediate file deletion), and transparency about processing (client-side vs. server-side).

The UI/UX will cater to this broad range via a simple default interface with clear, progressive disclosure of advanced options and dedicated tool sections.

## 3. Use Cases (Examples)

* **UC-01:** As a student, I want to upload my `.docx` assignment and convert it to `.pdf` for submission, ensuring formatting is preserved.
* **UC-02:** As a photographer, I want to upload 50 `.heic` photos from my phone, batch convert them to high-quality `.jpg` format, and download them as a single `.zip` file.
* **UC-03:** As a web developer, I want to convert a `.png` logo with transparency to a `.webp` format with specific quality settings.
* **UC-04:** As a remote worker, I want to connect my Google Drive account, select a scanned `.pdf` report, convert it to an editable `.docx` file using OCR, and save it back to Google Drive.
* **UC-05:** As a general user, I want to upload an `.mp4` video file and extract the audio as an `.mp3` file quickly.
* **UC-06:** As a premium user, I want to access my conversion history and manage my subscription settings.
* **UC-07:** As an administrator, I want to view registered users, manage subscription plans, and temporarily disable a specific conversion pair if needed.

    * **Premium Tier(s) (e.g., "Pro", "Business"):** Access to all supported conversions, higher/no limits, OCR, full batch processing, cloud storage integration, priority processing, ad-free experience, enhanced support. Tiered pricing (Monthly/Annual). Specific limits and pricing TBD.
* **Secondary Model:** Non-intrusive display ads on free tier pages (optional, evaluate impact on UX). Consider a "Donate" option.

## 8. Release Criteria / MVP Definition

* **Goal:** Launch "ASAP" with a comprehensive feature set ("Large MVP").
* **MVP Must Include:**
    * Core backend architecture (FastAPI, Celery/Redis, PostgreSQL).
    * Core frontend framework and UI shell (React/Vue).
    * Functional user account system (Register, Login, Basic Profile).
    * Functional Admin Panel (User/Subscription viewing, Feature flags).
    * Implementation of a significant subset of conversions listed in 4.2 across ALL categories (Documents, Images, Audio, Video, Archives), focusing on the most popular pairs first.
    * Functional Advanced Options framework (even if not all options are implemented for every format initially).
    * Functional Batch Processing (multi-upload, apply settings, download ZIP).
    * Functional Cloud Storage Integration (Google Drive, Dropbox - select input, save output).
    * Functional OCR (PDF/Image -> TXT/DOCX).
    * Implementation of the core security and privacy requirements (HTTPS, immediate file deletion).
    * Basic Freemium model infrastructure (ability to differentiate free/premium users).
* **Acknowledgement:** Achieving this full "Large MVP" scope simultaneously requires significant effort. Development will be iterative, focusing on delivering core modules first and rapidly expanding format support and feature depth within the MVP phase. "ASAP" launch depends heavily on efficient development and testing.

## 9. Future Considerations

* Expand support for more niche file formats based on user demand.
* Introduce basic file editing capabilities (e.g., image cropping, audio merging).
* Develop a public API for developers/businesses.
* Enhanced Admin Panel analytics and reporting.
* Integration with more cloud storage providers.
* Mobile applications (iOS/Android).
* Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

## 10. Maintenance Plan

* Implement comprehensive logging and application performance monitoring (APM).
* Establish a regular schedule for updating OS, dependencies, and conversion libraries, including security patching.
* Utilize a bug tracking system for reporting and managing issues.
* Perform regular database backups and ensure disaster recovery plan is in place.
* Provide user support via FAQ/Knowledge Base initially, potentially tiered email/chat support later.
